# pretty-money

A tiny money formatting library for JS

- **Small.** The code is dead simple and the size is controlled by [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)
- **FP-friendly.** The functions can be curried to create the formatting function that you need.
- **Tree-shakable.** You don't have to import the whole library to only format one currency.
- **International.** It supports the nationally-accepted currency signs and their placements for every currency.
