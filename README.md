A tiny currency formatting library for JS

- **Small.** The code is dead simple and the size is controlled by [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)
- **FP-friendly.** The formatting function can be curried to create the formatting function that you need.
- **International.** It used to ensure nationally-accepted formatting for every currency.
